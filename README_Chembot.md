# üß™ Chembot ‚Äî Molecular Modeling AI Agent

Chembot is an **AI-driven chemistry assistant** designed to streamline molecular modeling workflows for research and education.  
It converts **natural language and voice commands into SMILES codes** and visualizes them as **2D/3D molecular structures**, enhancing accessibility and efficiency in computational chemistry.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently a **prototype AI Agent for research and educational purposes only**, not for commercial use.  
> Future development aims to integrate **reinforcement learning‚Äìbased molecular modeling tools** and collaborative extensions with other cheminformatics systems.

## üß¨ Features

- **Voice & Text Interface:** Automatically detects available microphones for voice input using Whisper API.  
- **Natural Language to Structure:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to interpret chemistry-related commands and translate them into SMILES codes.  
- **Molecular Visualization:** Displays both 2D and 3D molecular structures using RDKit.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Developed in Linux but includes a `windowenv.yaml` file for Windows-based environments.  
- **Personal API Key Integration:** Users must connect their **own OpenAI API key** in the `.env` file for the application to function properly.
